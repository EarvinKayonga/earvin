`I` went, this week end (23-24 July), to Humanoid's Hackathon around ChatBots & the Medias. Well, I had no expectation because I didn't know how were create those softwares.

[Humanoid](http://humanoid.fr/) is the company  co founded by [Ulrich Rozier](https://twitter.com/UlrichRozier) and [Baptiste Michaud](https://twitter.com/bactisme) and is behind FrAndroid (famous online website about smartphones) and Numerama (digital in general).

## Demo of our chatbot:
<br/>

Our JonBot (Who know nothing) is chatbot which was designed for spec comparaisons between devices and a quizz around smartphones.

Because on the lack of time, we started implementing the quizz. The chatbot runs on Facebook Messenger but is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), communicates with Facebook via Facebook Send Api (NodeJs).

## Reflections

We wanted to the implement a conversationnal ChatBot but we need a Natural Language Processing (NLP) component for our app.
I found Wit.ai, [ABot](https://github.com/itsabot/abot), api.ai, chatfuel. We chose Wit because it was back by Facebook and therefore
maybe had easy ways by our app to Fb Messenger. Lot of tutorials  were available on Youtube and stuff
I knew [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/EarvinKayonga) since a long time. That goes back the period when I used Parse to store data for my Ionic App.
I, back then only saw wit as an entity bought by Facebook (like Parse).
`Wit` offers tools to implement Natural Language Processing. Its Hello World is a simple, well designed `What's the weather in any City` App.

`BUT`

after some hours, I noticed that paradigm for NLP was quite complicated. Also, Wit recently changed its API and documentation. The maintainers of the open source packages we were using , were therefore obsolete. SAD !!!
So we just did the quiz


## Chatbots Future

Today, Chatbots were already offering new ways to consume API. Instead of going through web App, you could just ask a question (via text or speech) to get u want. I really don't think ChatBots will replace Apps, they will be a compliment where a person could have a sms conversation to order a pizza instead of going on the NET.

`AND` in our scary overconnected society's Future, speech convos with bots will get things done replacing today keyboard/mouse in common usage (from Ulrich Rozier)
