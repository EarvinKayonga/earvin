`I` went, this week end (23-24 July), to Humanoid's Hackathon, with this Edition focusing on ChatBots & the Medias. Well, I had no expectation because I didn't use ChatBots.

[Humanoid](http://humanoid.fr/) is the company  co founded by [Ulrich Rozier](https://twitter.com/UlrichRozier) and [Baptiste Michaud](https://twitter.com/bactisme) and is behind FrAndroid (famous online website about smartphones) and Numerama (digital in general).

## Demo of our chatbot:
<br/>

Our JonBot (Who know nothing) is chatbot which was designed for spec comparaisons between devices and a quizz around smartphones.

Because on the lack of time, we started implementing the quizz. The chatbot runs on Facebook Messenger but is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), communicates with Facebook via Facebook Send Api (NodeJs).

## Reflections

We wanted to implement a conversationnal ChatBot but we need a Natural Language Processing (NLP) component for our app.
I found Wit.ai, [ABot](https://github.com/itsabot/abot), api.ai, chatfuel. We chose Wit because it was backed by Facebook and therefore
maybe had easy ways for our app to communicate with Facebook Messenger. Lot of tutorials, documentation  were available on Youtube and stuff
I knew [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/EarvinKayonga) since a long time. That goes back to the period when I used Parse to store data for my Ionic App.
I, back then only saw wit as an entity bought by Facebook (like Parse).
`Wit` offers tools to implement Natural Language Processing. Its Hello World is a simple, well designed `What's the weather in any City` App.

`BUT`

after some hours, I noticed that the paradigm for NLP was quite complicated. Furthermore, Wit recently changed its API and documentation. The open source packages we were using, were therefore obsolete. SAD !!!
So we just focused on the quiz


## Future of Chatbots

Today, Chatbots are already offering new ways to consume API. Instead of going through web App, you could just ask a question (via text or speech) to get u want. I really don't think ChatBots will replace Apps, they will be a addition to what we have Apps: but instead of going on the NET, u would just have a sms conversation to order a pizza 

`AND` in our scary overconnected society's Future, speech convos with bots will get things done replacing today's keyboard/mouse struggles in common usage (from Ulrich Rozier)
