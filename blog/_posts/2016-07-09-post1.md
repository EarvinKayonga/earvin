After several months using Docker, I started looking for ways to automate, or at least speed up the general routine of checking if:

- the `container is up`,
- looking for the name of the container,
- etc..

I've used Makefiles in the past for C/C++ projects and completly forgot about them. Then I saw [TJ](https://github.com/tjholowaychuk) building his React components, his Go projects and everything else with them.

[Simon Dittlman's post](http://www.itnotes.de/docker/development/tools/2014/08/31/speed-up-your-docker-workflow-with-a-makefile/) on Dockerfiles and Makefiles, by automating several common commands, convinced him pretty quietly.


Here is what I use:


{% gist EarvinKayonga/6038c56cc949c2b93028faaee1cf4e31 env_make %}

{% gist EarvinKayonga/6038c56cc949c2b93028faaee1cf4e31 Makefile %}

Running:

- `make build start` will build your docker container and start it in daemon mode.
- `make build run` will also build your docker container and run it
- `make logs` will display logs
- `make release` will build and publish Docker Images to Registry

Makefiles are extensible. New Rules could be easily defined:

#### make ssh:
To enter in running Docker Container

```
 docker exec -i -t  $(NAME)-$(INSTANCE) sh
```
NB: <sub>sh could be replaced by or bash or /bin/bash depending on if bash is installed in your images. My blog is based on AlpineOs. I uninstalled bash git g++ openssh in order to reduce the size of Docker Image</sub>


#### make test:
To test the Docker Container. I used that to test my test my Docker Registry by just running `make build start test`

```
  // USER and PASSWORD are either exported before running make ssh or defined in the env_make file
  docker pull alpine
  docker tag alpine localhost:5000/alpine
  docker login -u $(USER) -p $(PASSWORD) localhost:5000/alpine
  docker push localhost:5000/alpine

```
