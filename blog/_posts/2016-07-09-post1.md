After several months using Docker, I started looking for ways to automate, or at least speed up the general routine of checking if:

- the `container is up`,
- looking for the name of the container,
- etc..

I've used Makefiles in the past for C/C++ projects and completly forgot about them. Then I saw [TJ](https://github.com/tjholowaychuk) building his React components, his Go projects and everything else with them.

[Simon Dittlman's post](http://www.itnotes.de/docker/development/tools/2014/08/31/speed-up-your-docker-workflow-with-a-makefile/) on Dockerfiles and Makefiles, by automating several common commands, convinced him pretty quietly.


Here is what I use:


{% gist EarvinKayonga/6038c56cc949c2b93028faaee1cf4e31 env_make %}

{% gist EarvinKayonga/6038c56cc949c2b93028faaee1cf4e31 Makefile %}

Running:

- `make build start` will build your docker container and start it in daemon mode.
- `make build run` will also build your docker container and run it

Makefiles are extensible. New Rules could be easily defined:

make ssh:
```
```

make test:
```
```
