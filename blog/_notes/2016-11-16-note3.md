To ignore all files with the .jpg extension, use:
```
  svn propset svn:ignore "*.jpg" .
```

If you want to ignore multiple files or folders, use:
```
  svn propedit svn:ignore .
```

This will bring up your text editor so you can enter a list of files or directories to ignore.

To find files that are not under version control:

```
  svn status | awk '/^?/{print $2}'
```
